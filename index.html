                            </h3>
                            <p class="text-lg m-2 px-10 p-2">During World War II a few warplanes had returned after
                                missions.
                                It
                                was decided to strengthen the planes by adding armour on them.
                                After measuring the bullet holes on the warplanes it was found that
                                the fuselage had the highest bullets per unit area followed by the
                                wings and finally the tail. While common sense seems to dictate that
                                we reinforce the fuselage the most, the statistician Abraham Wald
                                steps in to save the day. He suggested that the areas with least
                                damage be reinforced.</p>
                            <p class="text-lg m-2 px-10 p-2">This is because we are looking at planes that actually made
                                it
                                back
                                after missions. Thus areas with damage symbolised areas that the
                                plan can get hit and still fly back to base. So the areas with minimal
                                damage and are critical to the plane and actually need to be
                                reinforced.</p>
                            <p class="text-lg m-2 px-10 p-2">This oversight is commonly known as Survivorship Bias.</p>

                                oscillatory motion by taking a step to the left. This triggers a
                                chain reaction where each soldiers in the same ring will take
                                a step to the left to take up the position emptied by the
                                front soldier. The soldier in the next ring will take a step in
                                the opposite direction (right) to trigger the chain reaction
                                where every soldiers moves to the right to fill up the space
                                emptied by the front soldier. So, there are seven circles of
                                alternate clockwise and anticlockwise rotating soldiers that
                                moves so fast that the enemy is completely lost and totally

                                as the actual strength of the inner rings cannot be
